# pokedex-app

This is a simple pokedex app I made for iOS. Although the content raises some childish memories 
it was mostly used to showcase the following principles (okay, it was also a lot of fun):

- Web requests<br>

  I worked with the AlamoFire framework to make requests and receive data
  
- Working with an API<br>

  The pokeapi.co was used to gather the relevant data and populate the collection view and infos about the pokemon
  
- Collection view<br>
  
  A styled collection view to make the received data appealing to the user
  
- AVAudioPlayer<br>
  
  Background music (with option to switch on/off) is used for better UX
  
- Filtering the data<br>

  Search function if user looks for specific data
